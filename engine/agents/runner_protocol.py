    """Minimal seam over the OpenAI Agents SDK Runner.

    The engine only depends on ``run_streamed``. ``agents.Runner`` from the
    openai-agents SDK satisfies this protocol structurally (its
    ``run_streamed`` is a staticmethod with a compatible signature). Tests
    can substitute a fake runner that returns a scripted stream of events;
    see ``tests/probes/probe_kit.py`` for the canonical fake.

    Only the kwargs the engine actually forwards are declared here. Adding
    a new kwarg to the engine means adding it here too — that asymmetry is
    a feature, since it forces the engine to acknowledge any new SDK
    surface it depends on.
