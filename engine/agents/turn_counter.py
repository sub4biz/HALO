Tells the agent which turn it is on and how many remain so it can
self-pace within its ``maximum_turns`` budget. Wired into the OpenAI
Agents SDK runner via ``RunConfig.call_model_input_filter``; one filter
instance is constructed per ``runner.run()`` call (i.e. per agent
execution) and increments its counter on each invocation.
