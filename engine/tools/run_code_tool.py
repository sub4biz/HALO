    Sandboxed code gets read-only TraceStore access plus numpy/pandas, no network,
    a writable temp dir, and a wall-clock timeout. The tool result is a typed
    ``CodeExecutionResult`` regardless of pass/fail/timeout, so the calling model
    can keep reasoning even when user code crashed.

    The tool itself is stateless: the live ``Sandbox`` comes through
    ``tool_context.sandbox`` (wired by the per-run ``make_ctx`` factory).
    Registration is gated upstream so ``tool_context.sandbox`` is always
    populated when this tool runs.
