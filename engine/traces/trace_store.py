# Two caps, by tool. The cap is compared against ``len(...)`` of the JSON-serialized
# attribute value, so the unit is *characters* of the string form (which is also a
# reasonable proxy for bytes on mostly-ASCII OTel attributes).
#   - ``_DISCOVERY_ATTR_TRUNCATION_CHARS`` (4 KB) is the cheap-discovery cap used by
#     ``view_trace`` (which can pull every span of a trace) and ``search_trace``
#     (which can match many spans at once). It preserves enough head-of-payload
#     for the model to see what was called and roughly what came back, without
#     the long tail.
#   - ``_SURGICAL_ATTR_TRUNCATION_CHARS`` (16 KB) is the surgical-read cap used by
#     ``view_spans``. The agent has explicitly named the spans it wants, capped
#     to 200 ids, so a higher per-attribute budget is appropriate — that's what
#     makes ``view_spans`` genuinely complementary to ``search_trace`` rather
