"""Pyodide-side runtime: bootstrap helper and capture-aware exec wrapper.

This file is loaded **inside Pyodide**, not by the host engine. ``runner.js``
reads it at boot via ``import.meta.url`` and runs it through
``pyodide.runPython`` so the two callables below become live Python
functions in the WASM interpreter. Every per-execute round trip then goes
through them — no JS-side string templates, no per-call Python code
generation on the host.

* :func:`halo_bootstrap` runs once after mounts: imports numpy/pandas plus
  the real ``engine.traces.trace_store`` (the runner stages the host's
  ``engine`` package source into ``/halo/`` at boot, so the same module
  the host runs is what user code sees — no parallel shim), loads the
  index, and stashes the resulting user-facing globals (``trace_store``,
  ``numpy``, ``pandas``, ``np``, ``pd``) in module state for later execs.
* :func:`halo_execute` runs every user-code request: exec's the source
  against the prebuilt globals with stdout/stderr captured into
  ``StringIO`` so the host gets clean text back regardless of whether the
  code crashed.

Splitting them lets the host distinguish setup failures (malformed
index, missing dependency) from user-code failures (assertion errors,
imports the agent shouldn't have tried) — both surface through the same
``{exit_code, stdout, stderr}`` shape but the host knows which phase
they came from.
