    ``lines`` is any iterable of (possibly newline-terminated) lines — a streamed
    file handle (``read_file``) or a subprocess's stdout (``git_read_file``); it is
    consumed once, so memory stays bounded to the window. Line numbering is
    ``\\n``-based, matching ripgrep, so file reads and ``grep_files`` agree on line
    numbers. Each line is capped at ``LINE_CHAR_CAP`` and total output at
    ``RESPONSE_CHAR_BUDGET``; ``truncated`` flags either clip. ``truncated``
    means output was clipped *within* the requested window — it does NOT flag a
    window that simply doesn't span the whole file (the caller sees that from
    ``total_line_count`` vs ``end_line``). ``start_line``/``end_line`` are ``0``
    when the window is empty.
